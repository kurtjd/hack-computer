# Jack Compiler
This is a compiler for the simple Jack programming language which outputs intermediate Hack virtual machine code.

It does not currently attempt to make any optimizations and the error reporting is pretty bad, but hey, it works!

# Requirements

# Build
Simply run `make`

# Run
`./hackjack <path-to-file/folder>`
