# Caterpillager
<img src = "Caterpillager.gif?raw=true">

A very (VERY) basic game made just to familiarize myself with the Jack programming language where you play as a Caterpillager infiltrating an ant colony to destroy the queen and take her sugar.

Simply use the arrow keys to move and walk into ants to destroy them while navigating through the tunnels.

## Requirements
A Jack compiler found [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) or as source code found here in this repo.

## Build
Use a Jack compiler to compile this folder into .vm files.

## Run
Use the Hack VM emulator found [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software).
